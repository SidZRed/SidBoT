This is a Virtual BOT for Siddharth. 
It was created using tkinter library for gui in python.
It has a very small existing knowledge base but the cool thing is that it is dynamically expansive ie. it can learn if you provide inputs for the questions which it doesn't know!

This was created mainly using python and it's libraries and using json files for storing the outputs.
